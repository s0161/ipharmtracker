# Trello-Style Dashboard Board

## Layout
Three columns replacing flat checklist panels on Today's Tasks tab:
- **Overdue** (red bg) — tasks past deadline
- **Due Today** (amber bg) — tasks needing action today
- **Done Today** (green bg) — tasks completed today

## Cards
- Cleaning tasks: `due` → Due Today, `overdue` → Overdue, `done` → Done Today
- RP checklist items: unchecked → Due Today, checked → Done Today
- "Upcoming" tasks hidden entirely

## Card content
- Task name, frequency pill, category label ("Cleaning" / "RP Check")
- Timestamp on Done cards

## Unchanged
- Staff Training stays off the board (compliance scores + Outstanding tab only)
- Filter pills, compliance rings, action required, quick-add, outstanding tab, print view

## Visual
- Subtle coloured column backgrounds, white cards with left-border accent
- Columns stack vertically on mobile
